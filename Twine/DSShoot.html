Also this will be very informal collection of ideas, disorganized, not formatted, maybe not even gramatical in some instances. I also jump around a lot so changes happen one place and I simply have yet to correct them elsewhere. Usually these will be stored in asterisked bullets near ends of significant passages, and depending on what they apply to will likely end up not tucked away in a specific branch.

Ok I think that&#39;s it lol

[[notes-start]]
[[draft 1 intro]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="notes-start" tags="p1 just-notes" position="372,39" size="100,100">general premise: 
	- you are ace (or aro depending on how writing turns out, both could fit in their own ways, or just have full on both aroace)
	- you don&#39;t know you&#39;re ace character until (near) end of game
	- have different characters you can date and get to know, each react to your reactions in different ways (described later)
	- during &#39;dates&#39; will take player to first-person shooter segments, purposefully unwinnable; aftermath is where different reactions kick in
		- most of the time the aftermath will be shown to player through texts/similar
		- (semi)final aftermath(s) will be in-person, likely at someone&#39;s place and really talks about why you aren&#39;t &quot;performing&quot;/&quot;reciprocating&quot;/etc
	- end of story, player learns about ace, and has opportunity to meet/date someone with same identity

gonna try not to push too much stuff (likes n dislikes, etc) onto player character if it can be helped, want player to feel like they could fit in here themselves. will use their name (request for input at start) and they/them/their neutral pronouns since it&#39;s not odd to (imo). i dont want character to be inherently of any gender and programming pronoun choice can be complex, plus might distract certain... crowds... from actually just playin instead of using their magnifying glass and blowing up such a small fuckin piece of the whole. hoo boy just wait til you find out ur supposed to be ace in this game!! love &#39;inventing people&#39; like this even tho ive seen it happen in real time (cough Celeste tiny trans flag at end of super hard extra dlc post game content cough)

ok sorry anyways

*note post starting draft: im just gonna focus on asexuality. if theres some similarity and relatableness to aro then great! but im not gonna go out of my way to try and super blur them together bc they really are such different experiences. sure theres an &#39;absence&#39; of some sort, what im trying to convey in difficulty of PC understanding it, but what that absence is exactly can mean a world of difference

	childhood friend: understanding, supportive, not surprised(? since they know you as much as you know them), helps you look into ace identity regardless and in all situations
	not-so-happy: tends to be most upset/frustrated with you, breaks things off the worst in the end (how bad? i don&#39;t want to berate player and then yknow, someone who genuinely went through something similar gets upset. maybe a filter/setting implement at some point for this)
	not-so-confident: for the longest time thinks &quot;it&#39;s me isn&#39;t it,&quot; not confident in themselves, thinks your aceness is just your disinterest and pulling at heartstrings
	not-so-interested: understanding, BUT wants a relationship with someone who wants the same out of it (aka &quot;reciprocates&quot; the same), ok with being acquaintances but in dating both of you find not so much in common after all

people and quick summaries. you only really ask childhood friend, everyone else offers their info to you rather than you asking. each character will have some different interests in you. friends are like &quot;wow how convenient!&quot; maybe, sure it&#39;s possible but i don&#39;t think it&#39;s very common to be asked out so much in one day by randoms lmao. i would have no fkin clue

at end of meeting everyone, player gets to decide who they wanna pursue dating for the game. (still debating if should allow any switching at certian points but uhhhh not likely)
each has their own reaction to you as you continue dating, some a bit tumultuous and maybe even uncomfortable (looking at you not-so-happy and -confident), anxiety inducing potential based on writing. will need to be careful. drafting phase maybe not so much since there&#39;s room to adjust but yknow. also censor to lessen what might be bad, needs alternative dialogue that will just end up less impactful

(trying to think of a decently unique connection? aside from childhood friend one has hobbies, other career path. maybe some connection from childhood? highschool, stuff they did with fam, i could just as easily make this an option but it might be hardest since nostalgia and memories are really hard to actually cover. maybe i really should care less about making player character this super blank slate aside from sexual orientation, sucks to write and program :p)

meet up at a fairly casual restaurant, you&#39;re aware of their conventional attractiveness (ya no hots tho). strike up convo, get some of their interests. have a career/aspiration/field of study similarity here, they attend a different school nearby hence having never seen them in classes you might&#39;ve otherwise shared. they also share some cute pet pics (get a bit close? im thinking they&#39;ll porbably have highest libido of all 4 chars, not that it&#39;s inherently gonna make people upset to find out their date is ace and doesnt wanna be intimate. theyre also not dating to just be intimate for the sake of it but they definitely care about it).

&quot;if you didn&#39;t want to then why even bother contacting me&quot; (either like :( or &gt;:( still deciding)
they kinda just cut you off in the end, not real pleased u asked them out and then didnt have the same interest in intimate stuff

	- religious reasons (maybe, dont know much abt religion and i dont wanna geet weird/rude/assume stuff about perceptions/experiences. there *is* at least a singular experience in one of my sources but theres no way i can get away drawing from just that, its all layers i straight up just dont know about. some knowledge just living around people who are/have been religious but idkkkkkk)
	- medical reasons (just have player character went recently for checkup, nothin wrong health-wise)
	- still care about an ex (however PC has never dated so this automatically wrong assumption! also idk, not everyone ties sex and romance so closely together? but some do i guess idk. ive always been under impression theyre one and the same but in reading about *aceness* i find out more about *non* aceness which i find hilarious, this being one of them :/)
	- awkward/lack confidence (theyll reassure you of course, but you PC knows thats not it)

precursor to end of game other ace character player will get to meet (foreshadowing events? big &#39;?&#39; in this instance)
	- friend 3 (not childhood) talks of someone they asked out and this person says no, describes their aceness as a reason (this would be a late game event ye)
	- ya just bump into em somewhere, before a date perhamps. brief interaction
	- NOT something, a NON event, they will NOT be in ur classes/clubs/whatever, NO common attendance to your usuals even if maybe they stop by a fav locaction like ONCE the whole story

[[notes-start]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="shooter visual idea" tags="p1 just-notes" position="602,160" size="100,100">OK MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO WRITE THIS INSTEAD OF STEWING OVER IT AND FORGETTING SOME STUFF LIKE I USUALLY END UP DOING OK OK

so, thematic visual design for the first-person shooter part
so
the idea ive got rn is, you trying and failing to be intimate with dates they way they want/expect. something like, against your nature, youre fighting the part of you that knows u dont really want/care for this (though yes! some aces are fully ok in engaging, usually with someone theyre already romantically involved with. for sake of not complicating the narrative just gonna make PC an uninterested person, not averse either just &#39;meh dont wanna&#39;. ok tangent here done)
what if
the shooter has you combatting with plant-like entities
and then at the end of the story, when u accept this very natural and not weird part of ur identity in being ace you end up being able to just, hang out with em, no shootin n bootin, just walk around the combat map a bit and see your new plantes friends. you no longer feel like a &#39;weirdo&#39; or some other &#39;othering&#39; term that i cannot think of a better one right now

ok done [[notes-start]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="potential dates" tags="p1 just-notes" position="372,844" size="100,100">not entirely sure what should happen when, and who it should happen with. not every character has to have exclusive dates happen, like more than one person is allowed to go on a walk in a park or w/e lol. maybe give each char their own &#39;special&#39; kind of date if i come up with enough ideas.
for organizational purposes, even if 2+ chars have the same date type im gonna keep their branches exclusive. thinking of doing at least 3 dates per person since im going to include in-between sections. i also dont want it to feel like it&#39;s &quot;very next day you go on yet another date&quot; so there will be variable gaps of time between encounters. how this will be conveyed depends on the scenario (eg narrator/internal thought, character talks directly about time difference, etc)

- walk/cycle in a park/public space (wow)
- out to eat (lunch, dinner, quick snack/dessert, etc.)
- stay in (study, TV/movie, games, baking just chillin)
	- this could be a later one for a few chars since it&#39;s probably most private, good time for a deep heart-to-heart
- event/show (comedy, theater/improv, music, etc)
	- i&#39;ve been to a DnD improv show before, it&#39;s pretty chill atmosphere, maybe something like this depending on character likes
- some specific physical activity that isn&#39;t walking (team sport, rock climbing, going to the gym ?????)
	- could people even consider this a date??? probably?? i&#39;d probably know if i did these things myself lol. i feel like most people might do this more in a longer term relationship buuuut also depends im sure......
- star gazing or watching fireworks
	- could work as a later date, more potential for deep convo i think
- online date (very unlikely i think, plus i dont wanna have to think about maybe programming a super special kind of dialogue sequence to make it feel online lol)
- cat cafe or something similar
	- ok but actually, i went on a friend-date with someone before and yes this is super cute. could be a unique event for a character since it feels pretty specific comapred to some other possible ideas

	
aaahh the struggles of writing a DATING SIM as someone who doesnt date lmfao
to avoid having to get super deep into what happens, im gonna do something where around the moment ~romance~ would happen im gonna have it cut to the fps. not right away, i want players to get the sense that yes, the other person is getting close (physically or maybe even emotionally, depends). fear is this could just seem like a sort of blackout, need to set things up just right but i wont know how exactly until i start getting into the details of each sequence

the hope is at some point during any narrative, theres a point where youre introduced to a new character whether through brief encounter or word-of-mouth, but nothing all that long. this person turns out to be ace, much like yourself. not to make it out like &quot;all aces date each other and no other identity&quot; or something like that, but i want to let the player know that it&#39;s not a one-off experience. i want the character you play as to have someone be relatable in experience, and help convey some common ace experiences (like &quot;ah yeah i was the same way in high school&quot; kinda talk).

just a space for player character to really get comfy, and make sure the ending isnt anything thats like, bad or sad or w/e</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="draft 1 intro" tags="draft1" position="1153,51" size="100,100">There won&#39;t be too much specific dialogue at this point, as the events themselves might end up rearranged or completely changed.

Alex, you&#39;ve known a long time since you two were young, and Silvia you both have known for quite some time now.

Your friends are sorta pestering you about luck on finding a date, as you&#39;ve still never been on one before. You know your fraternity&#39;s Big Event fundraiser is coming up as well, and while it&#39;s not necessary they want everyone to try and bring a plus one.  Even though your plus one doesn&#39;t have to be a romantic partner, this acts as an easy excuse for your friends to want to encourage you to try and really date someone for the first time.

You know Silvia is in a happy and healthy relationship, and Alex is currently single.  They also plan on bringing plus ones to your frat&#39;s Big Event, which is in just a few weeks time.

Your friends have to run off to another class right after you&#39;re done talking, leaving you to take your time before you leave as well.  On your way out you bump into another classmate you&#39;ve never talked to before, Eddie. After exchanging apologies and greetings, you find that you two are studying pretty similar tracks, and that they especially like video games.  Since you&#39;re both also struggling a bit with some class concepts, you decide to exchange numbers and maybe set up a study session at some point.

After getting back to your place and unpack your order, you notice something with a phone number, the name Gaile and &quot;text me ;p&quot; scrawled on it.  You set it aside for now and start eating.

You both decide on going to an ice cream parlour near campus after your classes today; neither of you have the same schedule for today.

Today you do have a class with Silvia, who you update on the details of your quest for finding a date.  They&#39;re excited for you, and hope that everything goes well! They give a few simple pointers, like make sure your ice cream doesn&#39;t drip on your clothes (based on a past outing of theirs, as they recall for you)!
---
Class ends, you and Silvia say your goodbyes, and you head on to the ice cream parlour.  Eddie is already waiting at an outside table by the joint, as they didn&#39;t want to order before you got there.  The both of you head inside and pick out your orders with no fuss.  Back outside, you begin to chat about what made you two want to study your major.  This segues into Eddie talking a bit about some of the games they like to play, and asks if you play many games yourself.  Finally, you both end up talking about how you squeeze free time around all your classes, and share a bit about your class schedule.  You find out that neither of you have any early obligations tomorrow, and are free in the morning and afternoon.

As you two go on, eventually you both finish your ice creams and decide it&#39;s time to head out.  As you head back to campus together, Eddie bumps a bit close to you and asks if you wanted to head back to their place, saying it&#39;s fine if you stay late since neither of you have much to do first thing tomorrow.

Tomorrow after both of your classes seems like the best time.
---
Later today, you&#39;re sitting in a class with Silvia who you tell about the date you have planned for tomorrow.  She&#39;s pretty stoked for you, and says she&#39;s inspired to take her parter there sometime herself.
---
Later, you and Gaile meet up at the cafe. You both order and eat your food before going where they actually let the cats run around (neither of you wants your food pilfered by a cat). In the room you two chat, play with the cats, and lament how neither of you have the right space to adopt one right now.  After leaving, Gaile notices you have a lot of cat fur stuck to your clothes.  They get really close as they start to get some of it off.

After soesome back and forth you agree a walk in the park would be nice. Before then you two also talk about some shows you like to watch.  Tanis recommends one of their favorites, and offers to lend you a DVD with the first season.

The walk is very pleasant, Tanis hands you their DVD before they forget.  Towards the end Tanis starts to seem a bit sheepish.  The two of you both happen to trip over a fallen branch neither of you noticed.  You accidentally fall on each other...

They offer to invite you to some morning cycling  on the nearby local trail then get some brunch afterwards, a bit impromptu since they aren&#39;t really free otherwise for a few days.  They let you know there&#39;s a bike rental shop if you don&#39;t have your own bike, which is perfect because you don&#39;t own one.
---
Next day is a class with Silvia, who asks you a bit about what compelled you to want to ask Alex out after you tell her about your current plans for tomorrow. You say you two have just been so close for a long time, you guess it makes sense? A bit of a noncommital answer, but Silvia sees the sense in it too.
---
The day passes, it&#39;s the following morning, and it&#39;s now time to meet up with Alex for your morning outing on the trail. Thankfully you&#39;re not terrible at riding a bike, Alex makes sure to keep pace with you anyways.  At the one end of the trail is the brunch place, so you guys take a break to chow down and digest.  On the way back to the start of the trail, you do accidentally stumble off your bike, so Alex helps pick you up; thankfully it wasn&#39;t a bad fall. Alex gets pretty close to you, and takes time to brush the dirt and dust off your clothes.

You two don&#39;t attend the same uni, but the campuses are close enough that meeting up is hardly an issue.
Their strong personality really shows when you two hang out, and you can definitely tell they have a deep attraction for you.

While the two of you have definitely seen each other around (seeing as you frequent their place of work), you don&#39;t really know much about each other until you start spending time together.  Gaile is great at leading the conversation, and is not afraid to get close and initiate any romantic talk/action.

Behind the scenes, this character is referred to as &quot;not-so-happy&quot; to briefly summarize your final encounter together.  Their initial reaction to you admitting you&#39;re not interested in anything physical is a bit heated, but they cool down by the next time they see you, making sure to apologize.

[[Back-&gt;Playtest Start 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="about Tanis" tags="" position="1835,387" size="100,100">You meet Tanis through a dating app you almost forgot you had.  They seem to be your only match since making your profile.
Someone who is quite shy, but really sweet, and you can tell from their dating app profile that they live in your same area.  You two do go to the same university, but as you&#39;re hoping to get into pretty different fields you&#39;ve never really seen them around.  They tend to be lofty, and has an interest in art and animation.
They love more personable dates, staying in for the most part to watch shows and movies together.  



Behind the scenes, this character is usually referred to as &quot;not-so-confident,&quot; and fills a kind of shy girl niche.  While after learning your lack of intimate desire leads them to lose some confidence in themselves for a bit, you are successful in reassuring them that it&#39;s really only a you-thing, and they are in no way the reason for the inequality of interest.  Any subsequent encounters, they tend to be a bit sheepish at first, but will eventually warm back up to you.

[[Back-&gt;Playtest Start 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="about Alex" tags="" position="1955,387" size="100,100">Your childhood friend that you&#39;ve known for pretty long, all the way back to middle school.  You two had a lot of similar classes, and even played some soccer for your school.  
When you first ask them if they wouldn&#39;t mind going on a date, they&#39;re obviously surprised as the two of you have been so close of friends for so long.  Still, they wouldn&#39;t mind as the two of you could enver be separated no matter what happen between you two.
When dating, the first-person shooter sequences aren&#39;t really brought on from a moment of their attempt at intimiacy, so much as you know that dating isn&#39;t really what you want out of your current relationship.


Alex will be present as a confidant throughout the entire story regardless of who you decide to try and date.  They&#39;re always supportive of you, and ultimately help you discover about your own identity.

To pull the curtains back, this character is fulfilling a common &quot;childhood friend&quot; trope from dating sims.  No matter whether you decide to try and date them or not, your friendship still remains strong, maybe even growing stronger as the two of you further discover your own identity.

It gets pretty later so you decide to head to bed and check your phone.  Lying in bed and going through all of your notifs before falling asleep, you actually notice you got a message on a dating app your friends had you download a while back.
You check the notification, a match from someone named Tanis.  Looking through their profile you se they&#39;re not far from your area at all, and that you have some hobbies in common.

Before you actually fall asleep you think it might be a good idea to message someone and ask them to see if they&#39;d want to set up a date.  This way you can just work on plans tomorrow first thing.

In the end, you find out that the player-character is asexual, which explains why it was so hard to get through certain interactions and moments with the person you were dating at the time.  Your &quot;lackluster participation,&quot; be it through sweet-talk, cuddling, or even more, is just a result of you never feeling the same things as, well, pretty much everyone around you it seems.  It doesn&#39;t come naturally to you, which is why these moments became moments of metaphorical struggle.  In the full, ideal game, these moments of struggle are conveyed through sequences of first-person shooter action, where the player is actually destined to lose no matter how much they try.
Though, this story obviously doesn&#39;t end on a low note, as being asexual is in no way a struggle-filled existence.  You do get to meet someone who has similar experiences and identity, which is shown in a finally-peaceful moment in the same chaotic shooter you once fought through.  Everything falls into place, you know who you are and come out the other side much more confident in yourself.

The day rolls by and you head to your class, the last one you have for the week, and one that Alex goes to as well.  You both get there early as usual, and you two talk about how your date went yesterday.  You tell Alex that Eddie wanted you over to spend more time together after ice cream, but that you declined.  Alex shares that they think that since it&#39;s your first date you didn&#39;t want to go overboard, something you can definitely agree with.  Though, you know there&#39;s something a bit more to why you didn&#39;t want to spend the night at Eddie&#39;s.  It&#39;s not nerves per se, but you can&#39;t really place it and just end up agreeing it must just be what Alex said.
---
Days pass and you&#39;re back in the same class you share with Silvia, Alex, and Eddie.  You and Eddie did talk a bit over messages regarding coursework before today, which you share with Silvia and Alex when they ask how things have been with you two.  You share that you and Eddie are going to meet up after class to decide on some plans for your next meetup, which Silvia and Alex are happy for you about.
---
Class ends, you say your farewells to your friends as usual, and you and Eddie meet up just outside the classroom.  As you two talk out of the building together, you discuss where you two might want to meet up again.  You two decide it would be really fun to grab some food at a restaurant, then head over to a locally-run arcade, a hole-in-the-wall kind of place you&#39;ve never heard of before.  Eddie has only been a few times, but they assure you there&#39;s a good spread of games and winnable prizes.  The weekend seems the best time, so you both wait until then.
---
The weekend finally rolls around, and you&#39;re pretty excited to check out this arcade.  You and Eddie have been talking over chat, and they tell you there will be plenty of familiar arcade classics like Pac-Man and even Dance Dance Revolution!
You two meet up at the restaurant, which is thankfully not busy considering it&#39;s a weekend evening.  You two have the usual chatter as you eat your food, things like sharing the day&#39;s events, a bit of talk about some class work, and how you both might see a group studdy sesssion in your future.
Dinner finishes up, and you both head on over to the arcade.  It really is a hole-in-the-wall kind of place, as it&#39;s up some stairs innto the second floor of an old office building.  Finally inside you can definitely tell that the place is pretty packed with a bunch of different games.  A prize area and token dispenser sits close to the entrance.  You and Eddie get your tokens and take to the floor, playing game after game, getting ticket after ticket.  Ski ball, Galaga, Guitar Hero, Resident Evil, Super Monkey Ball, you guys bounce from machine to machine.  Eddie seems pretty proficient in a lot of the games you play, winning a large chunk of your shared pool of tickets.  As the night goes on, they start to move closer and closer to you as you play at the various machines, even holding your hand between a few as they guide you to some of their favorites.

This time Gaile suggests getting dinner then attending a small local theater show, something lighthearted with simple production.
---
Next time you see Alex and Silvia in class you talk about the cat cafe, and how much fun you guys had. You also tell them you and Gaile already plan to meet up again for dinner and a show. Silvia says you must really like spending time with Gaile, which of course yeah, it&#39;s hard not to when both of you are playing with cats.
---
The time comes for your next date with Gaile. You meet up at the restaurant, nicely dressed for the show afterwards.  The meal was great, as was your conversation. Gaile is really passionate about their studies, and hopes to get into the grad program right after getting their degree as you find out.
You two head over to the show and run into one of the staff/performers, who turns out to know Gaile from a previous place of work. They exchange greetings and Gaile introduces you, before Gaile&#39;s friend has to head back stage and you two head into the theater seating. The show goes over without a hitch, and you two meet with Gaile&#39;s friend one more time before heading out.  The friend asks if yuo two have any other plans this evening, to which Gaile responds with a &quot;That depends.&quot; You say your farewells and the two of you head home. Before parting ways, Gaile gets quite close and holds your hands with little warning or words, and just gives you a small kiss on the cheek.

The two of you laugh about that time in the park you both tripped. Thankfully the DVD was safe! You two decide the next time you meet up it would be nice to go for dinner and a movie. A sequel to one of their favorites came out recently, and you&#39;ve seen the first one as well already so you won&#39;t be lost on the plot thankfully.
---
You meet Alex for lunch, a day before your date.  They ask how it went, and you tell them about the funny moment when you tripped, saying how Tanis was also stumbling after their own words afterwards which you thought was cute.  Alex states that Tanis must really think you&#39;re attractive, then. Really? You never really thought of that, so then Alex asks if you think Tanis is attractive as well. You say yeah, they&#39;re very conventionally attractive. Alex points out it&#39;s a bit weird you put it that way, and before they could ask more about how you really felt about Tanis their alarm goes off, they have a presentation rehersal soon and they gotta leave now to be on time!
---
Next day, it&#39;s your date with Tanis.  You&#39;re both dressed rather nicely, and dinner tasted great. Tanis still seems a bit nervous around you but the conversations are still rather fluid. You talk about the movie as you head over to the theater. Once there you notice it&#39;s not all that busy, and you get some popcorn and drinks. You grab seats in the back. Popcorn is shared between you two throughout the movie, with the occasional grabbing-some-at-the-same-time.

Movie finishes, it was pretty good! Leaving the theater you guys walk homw. Tanis makes a move to hold your hand as you walk...

You two have your usual back-and-forth, eventually deciding it would be great to set up another meet-up. Both of you have been meaning to go to a gallery not far from where you live, so you think this would be a great opportunity. You also plan to get a late lunch afterwards, since the gallery doesn&#39;t stay open all that long. Plus, Alex has a presentation rehearsal after lunch time that they definitely can&#39;t miss.
---
Next day you just have a class with Silvia, and she asks how the bike riding went considering you don&#39;t go nearly as often as Alex. You say you did keep up ok, but did manage to fall on the way back from brunch. You also tell Silvia about your next date at an art gallery. Silvia thinks that&#39;s a great idea, and would totally tag along but doesn&#39;t want to third wheel, plus she&#39;s busy around that time anyways.
---
A few days pass and you&#39;ve met up with Alex at the gallery. They&#39;ve already bought admission for the two of you ahead of time, and insists you don&#39;t have to reimburse at all. It&#39;s cool walking around the gallery; there are many different exhibits and pieces. Some are from a time long past, while others are from local artists. One of the exhibits is interactible, but has been placed in a rather narrow spot. You and Alex both laugh as you carefully cram in together to look at the piece.

Alex asks you how the date last night at the arcade went.  You had a lot of fun!  But you thought it was a bit weird how persistently close Eddie got at times, even when they weren&#39;t just helping you out at some of the machines. Alex asks if there was anything you liked or disliked about it, and you say you weren&#39;t bothered by it, it was just unexpected.  Alex then asks if you&#39;ve ever actually wanted to do soemthing like that with anyone before, and no one really comes to mind for you.  Before you two can elaborate further, Alex&#39;s alarm goes off.  Oh shoot, they gotta go or they&#39;ll be late for a group presentation rehersal!  They&#39;ll text you later, and with that they dash out the door.
---
Later that day you get a message from Eddie reminding you about an upcoming exam in your shared class that both of you totally did not study for yet. So, you set up an impromptu study session for tonight after both of you are done with classes.  Eddie offers to host, which you agree with.  You finish up the rest of today&#39;s schedule before heading over.
---
You get to Eddie&#39;s that night, a single-person apartment complete with kitchen, bedroom, and living space.  There&#39;s a moderate-sized couch and table across from a TV set featuring a few different game consoles of different generations and brands.  You situate yourself on the couch, and Eddie offers something to drink before joining you.
At first you guys start going over broad topics, narrowing down the ones you both seem to have trouble with and hope to tackle those first.  Yet, as if it can&#39;t be helped, your studying eventually leads to talking about Eddie&#39;s collection of consoles, and they&#39;re happy to pull out any you haven&#39;t tried before.  A bit of a study break before getting back to it.  You pick out Eddie&#39;s Nintendo 64 and a Zelda game, a safe bet for trying out an older one in their collection.  You two sit on the couch together, and you have the controller which Eddie helps you hold properly as it&#39;s not much like modern controllers.  While you play Eddie sits pretty close, a bit reminiscent of the closeness at the arcade.
You two do get back to studying, and like that time flies.  Before you&#39;re done cleaning up textbooks and whatnot, Eddie asks if you wanted to stay later or even for the night, play some more Zelda before heading to bed...

[[Surprise, another minigame!!-&gt;Eddie FPS 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="48" name="Gaile 3" tags="draft1 just-notes" position="1080,1243" size="100,100">The next day, you meet up with Alex for a quick lunch before they have to run off and join a class group to practice a presentation. After asking Alex about their day, they ask you how the date with Gaile went. You tell them about the show, which had great production value for how indie it was, and you guys went to a great place for dinner. Plus, they gave you a small kiss on the cheek. Alex then asks if you wanted to take it further, to which you reply no. So then they ask if you&#39;re not really feeling any chemistry with Gaile. You say it&#39;s not that, you had a lot of fun on your date, just that you never really thought about taking it further. Before you and Alex can continue, they realize that they have to go if they want to be on time to their group meeting, so off they go. They say they&#39;ll probably talk to you later.
On your way out of the shop, you get another text from Gaile. Some small talk later and they ask if you wanted to go to dinner sometime again soon, they say their friend recommended them a place that&#39;s really nice but still decently priced for the food. You would definitely have to dress very nicely. You agree, and the date is set.
---
It comes time for your date, and you&#39;ve made sure to dress proper for the occasion. Gaile is really well-dressed as well, a compliment you give that they can only smile in response before heading inside. Gaile already set up a reservation so getting to the table is hassle-free. And the prices really are surprisingly decent for the atmosphere and food quality, but still not that cheap which is fine.
After dinner as you head out of the restaurant, Gaile asks if there&#39;s anything else you might want to do together this evening. After some thinking, you suggest a walk in a nearby park, to which they giggle and agree. It&#39;s not a far walk, and the park trail is decently lit by the occasional lamppost. It&#39;s a full moon tonight as well, a beautiful sight against the smattering of stars in the sky. You and Gaile actually takl about the stars, and some funny hypotheticals about what space travel would be like. Eventually you two come to a fountain, which happens to be dynamically lit at night with a few gently changing lights illuminating the water. As you&#39;re stopped, Gaile takes this time to get really close again. They ask you if there&#39;s anything else you want to do, and ask if you might want to go to their place to spend the night.

You actually came late, so didn&#39;t have much time to tell them anything about the date other than the basic details, how you enjoyed the movie.
After class you find you got a text from Tanis, who is really excited about a new mini season for a show they really like becoming available to stream tomorrow evening. You suggest maybe you can come over and watch it with them since they seem to be singing such high praises about it, and they&#39;ve never gone wrong with their taste so far. They ask if you&#39;re ok wjumping right in to which you reply yes. You two set up a decent time that&#39;s not too late so that you can make sure to get a few episodes in.
---
You meet Tanis at their place; they seem a little nervous but still really excited. When you walk in you see they&#39;ve made their sofa to be as comfortable as possible, with lots of pillows and blankets on deck and ready to just jump right into. They offer some snacks and drinks, so you ask for something that&#39;s not too messy. You both get settled in on the couch each with your own set of blankets and pillows.
Watching the show is a really wild time. There&#39;s some plot that you don&#39;t quite understand from jumping in the middle, but Tanis makes sure to catch you up on anything supre big so you can keep up with what&#39;s going on. After a few episodes, in the brief lull before then next one starts, Tanis rather sheepishly asks if you are comfy enough, and maybe if you didn&#39;t mind cuddling for a bit.

While eating, Alex says they really want to know why you asked them out on a date, expecting you to say something about repressed feelings and the like. You say it&#39;s actually nothing like that, and give the same answer you gave Silvia days before. Having been such close friends for so long, it really only made sense, right? Alex, a bit confused by your response, suddenly remembers their rehearsal obligations and has to quickly leave, but they&#39;ll message you again later.
---
Alex never gets around to messaging you back about your earlier conversation. Instead, they remind you of a fireworks show that will actually be held in both of your old neighborhood. Nothing too grand or flashy, but the two of you rarely miss this biannual event. You guys make plans to drive down together for the night, which is not long off from now.
---
Nothing too exciting happens in the time between then and the fireworks show coming up. Alex offers to drive you both down; it&#39;s not too far but you&#39;ll both be there together anyways.
You get to the park where it&#39;s being held and find a decently secluded spot on a nearby hillside. Alex places the blanket they brought for you to share and you both wait for the show to begin. It&#39;s actually quite chilly, something both of you failed to prepare for, and you&#39;re already sitting on a blanket now wet with the evening dew. Alex decides to get close and lean against you to try and keep the both of you warm as you wait for the show to begin.

[[Game Over again!-&gt;Alex finale]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="55" name="Eddie finale" tags="draft1" position="935,1543" size="100,100">You tell Eddie thanks for the offer to spend the night, but you share with them that you don&#39;t really feel up to it.  You tell them you also had a lot of fun spending time with them, but you&#39;re not looking for nearly the level of intimacy they seem to be.  But, you&#39;d still be open to dating, as again you had lots of fun together.  Additionally, you ask if they&#39;d like to attend your frat&#39;s upcoming Big Event.
Eddie appreciates your honesty, but kindly declines your offer to keep dating, though they agree they had a lot of fun with you as well.  They&#39;re looking for a partner who wants to get as close and flirty as themself.  They also decline your offer to join you at the Big Event, but they do look forward to future study get-togethers, you two compliment each other really well in that regard.
With that, you two say your farewells and see-you-in-classes and you head back to your place.
---
It&#39;s the next day, and you&#39;re sitting in class with Silvia and Alex before lecture starts.  You tell them how things with Eddie went last night, which promptly reminds Silvia of someone her partner introduced her to just the other day.  She says their name is Blaine, stating that they&#39;re actually in the same boat as you when it comes to dating.  She then apologizes for the times she pressured you too much over finding one for your frat&#39;s Big Event.  Alex does as well, and you readily accept their apologies saying it was really no big deal, you know they meant no harm.

It feels like class ends as soon as it begins, and on your way out you see Eddie.  You both head out of the building together going over some of what you guys studies last night before just parting ways with a simple farewell.
On the way back to your place you get a message from Silvia, wondering if you&#39;d like to meet up with Blaine.  She says her partner can ask the same of Blaine and you two can exchange numbers.  You agree, and by the time you reach your dorm Silvia has sent you Blaine&#39;s number, who you assume now has yours as well.
You text Blaine, who responds not too long after.  You set up a place to meet after your class tomorrow, just a walk through the local green space. You finish out any assignments before heading to bed.

Gaile asks if you just want to take it slow, and you respond saying it turns out you don&#39;t really want the same thing out of a relationship as Gaile. Gaile is a bit upset by this, and asks why ask them out on dates in the first place if in the end the only things you wanted to do was hang out. You say you still had fun, but didn&#39;t realize that there would be such a disparity and what you were both looking for. Asking someone on dates seemed harmless even if it didn&#39;t really go anywhere. Gaile expresses their attraction for you, and how they would have really liked to get close and intimate at some point. After Gaile&#39;s confession, they give a curt farewell, you apologize and say bye as well, and Gaile leaves.
---
Eventually you do see Gaile at work, where you got their number in the first place. Gaile takes the time to apologize for their rash behavior, but still doesn&#39;t think it would be good to see you again aside from a purely casual basis. After your resolution, you head out to meet with Silvia and Alex.

You tell your friends about what happened, and how you figured you don&#39;t really want the same thing that it seems a lot of other people do when they find themselves in a relationship with someone. This reminds Silvia of someone her partner introduced to her recently, someone named Blaine who seems to have a lot of similar experiences to you. They offer to help you set a meet-up, which goes over well.  Later on you and Blaine do set up a time and place to meet.

[[One last date with Blaine?-&gt;Blaine ending]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="57" name="Tanis finale" tags="draft1 just-notes" position="1230,1543" size="100,100">Tanis paused what you guys were watching. They ask if you even have any interest in them. You tell them that of course, the time you guys spent has been super fun and you learned a lot about some things you already like to watch. Tanis asks if you even want to actually date, and you say you guess you just don&#39;t want all of the same things that they do and that it&#39;s in no way their fault. They still seem a bit sad, but reassured. Tanis asks if you still want to finish what you guys were watching, and you say of course. Afterwards you have some awkward goodbyes before you head home.
---
Next time you see them it&#39;s to return the DVD they lent you on your first date. You finished the first season and really enjoyed it, so Tanis decides they&#39;ll lend you the next few seasons. Tanis is a bit shy when you guys meet up in-person, but you two still talk a good bit about the show that you&#39;re watching.
---
After telling Silvia and Alex what happened, Silvia talks about someone their partner introduced them to, Blaine, and if you&#39;d like to meet them since you seem to have some similar experiences with dating from what Silvia recalls. So, you and Blaine eventually arrange a casual meet-up.

[[One last date with Blaine?-&gt;Blaine ending]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="58" name="Alex finale" tags="draft1 just-notes" position="1380,1543" size="100,100">Still close to you, Alex asks again why you asked them if they wanted to date in the first place. They&#39;ve known you so well for so long, and jokingly said they probably would have known by now if you had any sort of crush on them. You admit you don&#39;t actually have any feelings for them, and Alex honestly asks if you&#39;ve ever actually had any sort of physical attraction for anyone. You both know you&#39;ve never gossiped about crushes or any of the sort before. Alex is really supportive, and wants to help you figure out your identity after you&#39;ve come to these conclusions.
The fireworks start, and they&#39;re as great as they&#39;ve always been.
---
The next time you meet with both Alex and Silvia, you and Alex let Silvia know what happened. She&#39;s very understanding and doesn&#39;t press for a lot of details, but knows that you and Alex will always be close. Learning of your experience, she remembers a friend of her partner, Blaine, whom she was introduced to recently. She asks you if its ok to maybe see if you and Blaine can meet up; Alex thinks this is a wonderful idea as well. Silvia gets you and Blaine in contact, and the two of you set up a place to meet.

You two hit it off pretty well, talking about some of the things you guys like and what you&#39;re both studying. Eventually the conversation turns to the experiences both of you had with dating. Blaine shares how they were always so oblivious to other people&#39;s flirting and advances. You share a similar sentiment as well as some of your recent experiences. 
Lunch is over and you two decide to walk and chat a bit more. Blaine shares that they are asexual, never really experiencing some of the same desires for closeness as other might. You express that now you might think you&#39;re the same as well after all this, and ask Blaine more about it. Blaine, modest about how well they can explain it, says it&#39;s just that: varying degrees of a lack of desire for physical intimacy. They assure you it&#39;s nothing bad either, that there&#39;s nothing wrong with it just like any other queer orientation. They leave it at that and share with you some sources so you can learn more about it and some communities.
After this, you both part ways and say farewells, already talking of ways to keep in touch and get together again sometime.

You decided to invite Blaine as a friend, who gladly accepts since they also know Silvia and her partner, and wouldn&#39;t feel too out of place in your friend group. Alex shows up with an old flame of theirs, who moved back to the area just recently. Everything is a blast, and you all go home happy.

The three of your are in the same fraternity, and with this Big Event coming up Silvia takes this as an opportunity to encourage you to find a date. She doesn&#39;t mean anything by it, and isn&#39;t unbearably persistent about it, she&#39;s just doing her best to support you.
